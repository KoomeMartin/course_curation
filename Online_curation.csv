    Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)
    Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)
    Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)
    Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)
    Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)
    Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)
    Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x’Ax > 0, applications)
    Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)
    Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices, Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform, linear programming)
